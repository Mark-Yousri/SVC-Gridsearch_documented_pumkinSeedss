# Pumpkin Seeds Classification

This notebook is a machine learning project that aims to classify pumpkin seeds into two types: Çerçevelik and Ürgüp Sivrisi. The dataset contains 2500 samples of pumpkin seeds with 13 features, such as area, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, convex area, equivalent diameter, eccentricity, solidity, extent, roundness, aspect ratio, compactness, and class.

The notebook consists of the following steps:

- **Data exploration and preprocessing**: The notebook imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset from an Excel file. It then performs some basic data analysis, such as checking for null values, duplicates, and descriptive statistics. It also drops some columns that are highly correlated or have low correlation with the target variable. It also optimizes the area feature by scaling it down and replaces the string classes with numerical values.
- **Data visualization**: The notebook uses seaborn and matplotlib to create various plots, such as heatmaps, pairplots, and boxplots, to visualize the distribution and relationship of the features.
- **Model building and evaluation**: The notebook splits the data into train and test sets, and applies different machine learning models, such as logistic regression and support vector machine (SVC), to classify the pumpkin seeds. It also uses grid search to tune the hyperparameters of the SVC model. It then evaluates the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. It also prints the confusion matrix and the classification report for each model.

The notebook concludes that the SVC model with polynomial kernel and C=100 has the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 86.97% on the test set.
